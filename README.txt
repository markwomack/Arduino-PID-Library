This is a fork of the popular PID library by Brett Beauregard. I've used this library a lot,
but wanted a version of the api and code that was better formated and modernized. This is
it. It is exactly the same functionality, but the code has been reformated, methods renamed
slightly to have lowercase starts, and member variable names changed to more modern versions.

If you have any further suggestions, then please let me know. Mr. Beauregard's original text
is below.
