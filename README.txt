This is a fork of the popular PID library by Brett Beauregard. I've used this library a lot,
but wanted a version of the api and code that was better formated and modernized. This is
it. It is exactly the same functionality, but the code has been reformated, methods renamed
slightly to have lowercase starts, and member variable names changed to more modern versions.

While the functionality is the same, this version is not a drop-in replacement for the original.
Changes to client code will need to be made, primarily changing the method names to match
the version in this library. Otherwise, the prameters are the same.

If you have any further suggestions, then please let me know. Mr. Beauregard's original text
is below.
